Here’s how it works:</span></p><h3><strong>Send me an Email</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you need to do is send me an email at </span><a href="mailto:slate.powell@protonmail.com">slate.powell@protonmail.com</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and let me know that you are interested in doing counselling with me. We can then have a discussion about what times and days suit you, and if I have availability that fits your needs, we can book in our first session.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be really helpful if you let me know a very brief outline of why you are thinking about counselling, as this can help me work out if I will be the right counsellor for you. If I think another counsellor would be a better match, I will signpost you to the most appropriate therapists or services. </span></p><h3><strong>Optional Free 15 Minute Phone Call</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I offer a free 15 minute phone call for anyone who wants to explore if working with me is the right option for them. You can email and ask for a call (don’t forget your phone number and what times suit you) and we can arrange one. If things feel right, we can book our first session during the call, but there is no pressure – you are welcome to take some time to decide. </span></p><h3><strong>Your Welcome Pack</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we have agreed our first session time and date, I will email you a Welcome Pack that includes my Contract and Privacy Policy. The Contract lays out how I work, including my payment details, and I ask you to read through these documents before we meet, in case they bring up any questions for you that we can discuss in our first session. </span></p><h3><strong>Our First Session</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the morning of our first session I will email you a Zoom invite – this serves as a reminder of our meeting time too. We meet online for 50 minutes, to talk through the Contract and Privacy Policy together. I can answer any questions that you have, and we will have time to get started on why you are seeking counselling right now. At the end of this session, I will ask if you want to continue counselling with me, and if so we will book in the next five sessions. A benefit of online counselling is that you can have things around you that feel soothing, like a fidget toy, a cuddly animal, a blanket or your pet, and you can take care of yourself after the session without having to worry about driving home or catching the bus.</span></p><h3><strong>And Onwards...</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually we meet at the same time and day each week. I recommend starting with a block of six sessions, with a review at the end to see how things are going, and if we both feel that more sessions will be helpful. Some people have six sessions, some come to counselling for six months, and some for a year or more.</span></p></main></div></body></html>
