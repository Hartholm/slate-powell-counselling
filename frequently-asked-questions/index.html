Is that normal?</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Totally normal! People usually come to counselling because something in their life is hurting or needs to change, and it can be scary to face those uncomfortable or painful feelings. If you’ve gotten this far, that’s already a really brave step. When you email me, you are welcome to ask for a free 15 minute phone call, to see how it feels to talk to me. Our first counselling session is mostly saying hello and gently going through the Contract and Privacy Policy, which will give you a chance to relax a little and learn more about how counselling with me would work and feel. Most clients usually feel less anxious when they realise I’m just a person too! </span></p><h3>Where are you based?</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am located in South Yorkshire, but working online means I can work with clients across the UK, and we can keep our continuity even if you move. Please note that I cannot work with clients outside of the UK.</span></p><h3><strong>Can I have face to face counselling with you?</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I only offer online counselling at this time. If you are reluctant to try online therapy, I understand! I originally thought it couldn’t possibly be as effective or ‘real’ as face to face counselling. But when COVID meant that all the therapy offered through my workplace was online for a year, I quickly realised that it truly can be just as meaningful, connected and powerful – with the bonus of being more convenient, avoiding travel, and in your own comfortable surroundings. </span></p><h3><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My fees are £55 for each 50 minute session, paid online and within 24 hours of our session. </span></p><h3><strong>Is it confidential? </strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes - everything we talk about is just between you and me, with some very specific exceptions, which are outlined in the Contract I share with you when you book in for a first session.</span></p><h3><strong>I’m not LGBTQIA – can I still come to you for counselling?</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course! Everyone is welcome, and if you are cis, straight, or monogamous, you’re included in that warm welcome.</span></p></main></div></body></html>
