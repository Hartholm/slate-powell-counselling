You can learn more about what that means </span><a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/about-therapy/types-of-therapy/integrative-counselling/">here</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but put simply, it means that I tailor your counselling to your unique needs. I use a person-centred approach, where the most important part of our work together is the relationship between client and counsellor. That’s one of the reasons why I am sharing this information about me, so you can decide if you think we would be a good fit. I also integrate and incorporate elements of other types of therapy (like CBT or psychodynamic models), according to what might be most helpful for you. I am always happy to talk more about how integrative counselling works!</span></p><h3>My experience</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been a qualified counsellor for ten years now, but came to it in a roundabout fashion. With degrees in Anthropology and Museum Studies, I soon found that working in a museum wasn’t allowing me to help people tell their stories and live happier lives in the way that I wanted. I tried a counselling course taster and fell in love with therapy. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I completed my Professional Diploma in Counselling and Psychotherapy in 2015, and achieved my BACP Accreditation in 2021. Since qualifying I have worked and volunteered in diverse services, with a focus on trauma work and women’s mental health:</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://vidasheffield.org.uk/">Vida Sheffield</a></span></li><li><a href="https://www.rothacs.org.uk/">Rotherham Abuse Counselling Service</a> </li><li><a href="https://www.rothacs.org.uk/" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sodit.org/">Survivors of Depression in Transition</a></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sharepsychotherapy.org/ ">Share Psychotherapy</a></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/health-service/more-services/information-resources/mental-health ">Student Mental Health, Counselling and Therapies Service, University of Sheffield</a></span></li></ul><h3>My queerness</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a queer, polyamorous, trans nonbinary person, and I use they/them pronouns. I feel that it is important to be open about my queerness with my clients, not just because it is an essential part of me, but because I want to show my clients that their whole selves are welcomed too. I am experienced at working with LGBTQIA and Gender, Sex, and Relationship Diverse clients and regularly undertake CPD to help me be the best counsellor for you. </span></p><h3>My spirituality</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faith and belief are central parts of many people’s lives, and can play powerful roles in healing and personal development. In my counselling practice I seek to create an atmosphere where my clients are welcome to bring their spiritual beliefs into the work, for exploration, examination, and support. As a Pagan with childhood roots in Catholicism and a daily secular meditation practice, I welcome clients of any faith or belief, or none.</span></p></main></div></body></html>
